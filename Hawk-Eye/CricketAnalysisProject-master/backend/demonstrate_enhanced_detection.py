Demonstration of Enhanced Cricket Ball Detection Algorithm

This script demonstrates the key improvements made to address your specific requirements:
1. Spherical/circular object detection with proper circumference understanding
2. Minimum velocity requirements (30kmph minimum)
3. Minimum distance tracking (15m minimum, 13m for validation)
4. False positive removal based on motion patterns
