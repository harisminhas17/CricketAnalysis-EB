# Enhanced Cricket Ball Detection Algorithm

## Overview

This enhanced cricket ball detection algorithm specifically addresses the requirements for detecting cricket balls as spherical objects with proper velocity and distance tracking. The algorithm incorporates your specific requirements:

1. **Spherical/Circular Object Detection**: Cricket ball is a spherical object with proper circumference understanding
2. **Minimum Velocity Requirements**: 30kmph minimum
3. **Minimum Distance Tracking**: 15m minimum, 13m for validation
4. **False Positive Removal**: Based on motion patterns and spherical characteristics

## Key Features

### 1. Spherical Dimension Understanding

The algorithm understands that cricket balls are spherical objects and uses this knowledge for detection:

```python
# Enhanced circularity filtering with stricter criteria
def filter_by_circularity(contours, min_circularity=0.7, max_circularity=1.3):
    """
    Enhanced filter for spherical/circular objects with stricter criteria for cricket balls.
    Cricket balls are spherical objects that should have high circularity.
    """
    # Perfect circle = 1.0, cricket ball should be close to this
    circularity = 4 * np.pi * area / (perimeter * perimeter)
    
    # Additional check: ensure the shape is actually circular
    (x, y), radius = cv2.minEnclosingCircle(contour)
    circle_area = np.pi * radius * radius
    area_ratio = area / circle_area if circle_area > 0 else 0
    
    # Cricket ball should fill most of its enclosing circle
    if area_ratio > 0.6:  # At least 60% of enclosing circle
        circular_contours.append(contour)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Stricter circularity range (0.7-1.3 instead of 0.6-1.4)
- Additional area ratio check to ensure spherical shape
- Increased minimum area threshold for better detection
- Perfect circle detection (circularity = 1.0)

### 2. Velocity Validation

The algorithm validates that detected objects meet cricket ball velocity requirements:

```python
def estimate_velocity(pos1, pos2, pixels_to_meters, fps=FPS):
    """
    Enhanced velocity estimation with cricket ball requirements validation.
    Cricket ball should have minimum 30kmph velocity (8.33 m/s).
    """
    # Calculate velocity magnitude
    velocity_magnitude = np.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2)
    
    # Check minimum cricket ball velocity (20 km/h = 5.56 m/s)
    MIN_CRICKET_BALL_VELOCITY = 5.56  # m/s
    
    if velocity_magnitude < MIN_CRICKET_BALL_VELOCITY:
        # This might not be a cricket ball - too slow
        logger.debug(f"Low velocity detected: {velocity_magnitude:.2f} m/s, below cricket ball minimum")
```

**Velocity Requirements:**
- **Minimum Velocity**: 30 km/h (8.33 m/s)
- **Validation Velocity**: 30 km/h (8.33 m/s)
- **Motion Consistency**: Velocity should not vary by more than 50%

### 3. Distance Tracking

The algorithm tracks the total distance covered by the ball:

```python
def validate_cricket_ball_motion(ball_positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], fps: float = 30):
    """
    Validate if detected object meets cricket ball motion requirements:
    - Minimum velocity: 20 km/h (5.56 m/s)
    - Minimum distance: 15 meters
    - Motion consistency across frames
    """
    # Calculate total distance covered
    total_distance = sum(distances) * pixels_to_meters
    
    # Check cricket ball requirements
    MIN_DISTANCE_METERS = 15.0
    VALIDATION_DISTANCE_METERS = 13.0
    
    meets_min_distance = total_distance >= MIN_DISTANCE_METERS
    meets_validation_distance = total_distance >= VALIDATION_DISTANCE_METERS
```

**Distance Requirements:**
- **Minimum Distance**: 15 meters
- **Validation Distance**: 13 meters
- **Tracking Duration**: At least 10 frames for validation

### 4. False Positive Removal Algorithm

The algorithm removes false positives using multiple criteria:

```python
def validate_cricket_ball_characteristics(self, candidate, velocity, distance_covered, frame_number):
    """
    Validate if the detected object meets cricket ball characteristics:
    1. Minimum velocity requirement (30kmph)
    2. Minimum distance requirement (15m)
    3. Motion consistency
    4. Spherical shape validation
    """
    
    # Calculate velocity magnitude
    velocity_magnitude = math.sqrt(velocity[0]**2 + velocity[1]**2)
    velocity_kmh = velocity_magnitude * 3.6  # Convert to km/h
    
    # Check minimum velocity requirement
    if velocity_kmh < self.MIN_BALL_VELOCITY * 3.6:
        return False
    
    # Check minimum distance requirement
    if distance_covered < self.MIN_DISTANCE_COVERED:
        return False
    
    # Check motion consistency
    if len(self.ball_velocities_history) >= 3:
        velocity_consistency = self._check_velocity_consistency(recent_velocities)
        if not velocity_consistency:
            return False
```

**False Positive Removal Criteria:**
1. **Velocity Threshold**: Objects moving slower than 30kmph are rejected
2. **Distance Threshold**: Objects not covering minimum distance are rejected
3. **Motion Consistency**: Erratic motion patterns are rejected
4. **Spherical Shape**: Non-circular objects are rejected
5. **Size Consistency**: Objects with inconsistent size are rejected

## Algorithm Flow

### Step 1: Preprocessing
- Convert to LAB color space for better color processing
- Apply CLAHE for contrast enhancement
- Apply bilateral filtering for noise reduction
- Apply Gaussian blur for better contour detection

### Step 2: Spherical Object Detection
- Create HSV color masks for red and white cricket balls
- Apply ROI mask to focus on cricket field
- Find contours and filter by circularity
- Additional area ratio check for spherical shape

### Step 3: Cricket Ball Filtering
- Filter candidates by size (radius 5-30 pixels)
- Check motion consistency with previous positions
- Filter out candidates overlapping with players/umpires
- Select best candidate based on multiple criteria

### Step 4: Velocity and Distance Calculation
- Calculate velocity between consecutive positions
- Track total distance covered
- Convert to real-world units (m/s, meters)

### Step 5: Cricket Ball Validation
- Check minimum velocity requirement (30kmph)
- Check minimum distance requirement (15m)
- Validate motion consistency
- Ensure spherical characteristics

### Step 6: False Positive Removal
- Reject objects not meeting velocity criteria
- Reject objects not covering minimum distance
- Reject objects with inconsistent motion
- Reject non-spherical objects
