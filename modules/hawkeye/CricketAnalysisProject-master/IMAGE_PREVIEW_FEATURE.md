# Image Preview Feature for Cricket Community Feed

## Overview

## Features Added

### 1. Image Preview Display
- When a user selects an image file, it is immediately displayed below the file input
- The preview shows the actual image with proper sizing and aspect ratio
- Maximum height is limited to 300px to prevent oversized previews
- Images are displayed with `object-fit: cover` for consistent appearance

### 2. File Information Display
- Shows the selected file name
- Displays file size in MB
- Provides clear visual feedback about what file is selected

### 3. Remove/Replace Functionality
- Users can remove the selected image using the "Remove" button
- A floating "×" button on the image preview for quick removal
- Users can select a new image to replace the current one

### 4. Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
- Automatic cleanup when component unmounts
- Efficient handling of file selection and removal

## Technical Implementation
